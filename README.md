# Infinite Cat Scroll

Welcome to the **Infinite Cat Scroll** project! üê±

## Description

The Infinite Cat Scroll is a delightful web application that allows users to scroll through an endless stream of adorable cat images. Whether you're a cat lover or just need a dose of cuteness, this project has got you covered!

This project is part of my journey to improve my React skills and get more familiar with Vite and Charka UI.
